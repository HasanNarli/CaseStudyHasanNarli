# CaseStudyHasanNarli


Hi,

I couldn't complete the case study as you requested. This week has been extremely busy for me, and I didn't have enough time. I'm really sorry about this because I wanted to move to the next stage with you.

In the final hours, I tried to create the designs using programmatic auto layout and fetch the service using URLSession to build a general application. I know there are many shortcomings, but I simply didn't have enough time.

If I move to the next technical interview stage, I can explain how to address all the issues. I would be very grateful for this opportunity.

Best regards,
Hasan Narli
